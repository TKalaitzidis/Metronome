# React Metronome 🎵

The React Metronome project is a dynamic tool designed to aid musicians in practicing their rhythm and timing. It offers a user-friendly interface where musicians can adjust tempo, beats per measure, and rhythm patterns, all while visually and audibly keeping track of time.

# Key Features:

1. Adjustable Tempo: Users can fine-tune the tempo of the metronome, ranging from 20 to 300 beats per minute (BPM), catering to various musical genres and skill levels. 🕺
2. Beats Per Measure: Flexible beat settings allow users to set the number of beats per measure, offering versatility for different time signatures and musical compositions. 🥁
3. Customizable Rhythms: With the ability to toggle stress on the first beat, musicians can simulate different accent patterns, essential for practicing syncopation and emphasizing downbeats. 🎶
4. Visual Feedback: The interface provides a clear visualization of the current tempo, aiding users in staying synchronized with the metronome. 🕐
5. Audible Cues: Utilizing audio files, the metronome emits distinct sounds for stressed and unstressed beats, enhancing rhythmic precision and musicality. 🔊
6. Intuitive Controls: Simple controls, including a play/pause button and interactive sliders, offer an intuitive user experience for adjusting settings on-the-fly. 🎚️
